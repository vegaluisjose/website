I am a fourth year PhD student in the Allen School (CSE) at the University of
Washington, advised by [Luis Ceze] and [Dan Grossman].

I am broadly interested in programming languages and compilers, particularly
for the purpose of programming and designing specialized hardware. There is an
increasing interest in hardware acceleration due to major improvements in terms
of performance-cost-energy compared to general-purpose hardware. However, most
languages and compilers for accelerators today are lagging behind,
resulting extremely challenging to efficiently build robust specialized
systems.

My research focuses on creating principled and highly productive
tools and languages that tackle programming challenges around
hardware accelerators.

I hold a M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of
Kaiserslautern (Germany) and a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from the
University of Los Andes (Venezuela). Prior to joining UW, I worked as a staff
research associate in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the
University of California, San Diego.
