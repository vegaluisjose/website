I am a fourth year PhD student in the Allen School (CSE) at the University of
Washington, advised by [Luis Ceze] and [Dan Grossman].

I am broadly interested in programming languages and compilers, particularly
for the purpose of programming and designing specialized hardware. There is an
increasing interest in special-purpose hardware due to major improvements in terms
of performance-cost-energy compared to general purpose counterparts. However, most
languages and compilers today are lagging behind, resulting extremely
challenging to efficiently build robust specialized systems.
